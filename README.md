# Loan_Defaults_prediction
Developing a loan default prediction model by analyzing historical  data and identifying key factors that contribute to loan defaults.
The model will enable lenders to assess the risk associated with potential borrowers and make more informed lending decisions.
The project will utilize historical loan data, including borrower information, loan characteristics, and repayment behavior, to build a predictive model.
The analysis will focus on identifying patterns, trends, and risk factors associated with loan defaults.
The project will also explore the impact of different loan types and borrower profiles on default rates.
